      <description>hl2 Panorama provides a REST API respecting the standard methods and status codes of HTTP. We&amp;rsquo;re also doing our best to provide meaningful endpoints which can be integrated easily into your infrastructure.
OpenAPI Specification As described before, we strongly believe in standards as a way of communication between us and our customers. That&amp;rsquo;s why we have chosen to write an OpenAPI descriptor publicly available on GitHub. Here is a quote from the readme of the OpenAPI Specification repository on GitHub.</description>

      <description>Any request made to the hl2 Panorama API must include the following Authorization header, containing a valid API key for your organization. API keys are created through the hl2 Panorama web interface.
Authorization: Bearer API_KEY   Several different keys may be created, or the same key can be shared by several users of the API. Be aware, though, that using the same key for several concurrent processes could induce rate limiting issues, just as firing many requests in rapid succession in any single process could.</description>

      <description>hl2 Panorama provides a REST API respecting the standard methods and status codes of HTTP. We&amp;rsquo;re also doing our best to provide meaningful endpoints which can be integrated easily into your infrastructure.
OpenAPI Specification As described before, we strongly believe in standards as a way of communication between us and our customers. That&amp;rsquo;s why we have chosen to write an OpenAPI descriptor publicly available on GitHub. Here is a quote from the readme of the OpenAPI Specification repository on GitHub.</description>
